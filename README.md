# Python Basics for Computational Techniques

[![Deploy Jupyter Book](https://github.com/crisnapatel/python-basics/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/crisnapatel/python-basics/actions/workflows/deploy.yml)

**Live Site:** [https://crisnapatel.github.io/python-basics/](https://crisnapatel.github.io/python-basics/)

A beginner-friendly Python tutorial designed for **CHL7002: Computational Techniques for Chemical Engineers** students at IIT Delhi.

---

## What Is This?

This is an interactive [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/) website that teaches Python fundamentals through the lens of numerical methods. The running example throughout the tutorial is the **falling parachutist problem** from your textbook (Chapters 1–5), which introduces Euler's method and demonstrates why programming is essential for engineering.

---

## Topics Covered

| Topic | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Try Python** | In-browser Python playground (JupyterLite) |
| **Parachutist Problem** | Running example with video & interactive simulation |
| **Data Types** | Integers, floats, strings, booleans |
| **Variables** | Assignment, naming, and operators |
| **Print & Comments** | Output and documentation |
| **Control Flow** | `if`/`else`, `for` loops, `while` loops |
| **Data Structures** | Lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets |
| **Iterators** | `range()`, `enumerate()`, `zip()` |
| **User Input** | Reading input from users |
| **Functions** | Defining and calling functions |
| **NumPy Basics** | Arrays, operations, broadcasting |
| **Common Errors** | Reading tracebacks, debugging tips |

---

## Interactive Features

- **Parachutist Simulation** — Adjust mass, drag, and time step to visualize Euler's method in action
- **Mind Map** — Collapsible tree view of all Python concepts with code examples
- **Python Playground** — JupyterLite environment to run code directly in your browser (no installation)

## Deployment

The site automatically deploys to GitHub Pages on every push to `main` via GitHub Actions. The workflow:

1. Builds the Jupyter Book (classic v0.15.x)
2. Includes JupyterLite for in-browser Python
3. Deploys to GitHub Pages
