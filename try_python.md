# Try Python in Your Browser 🚀

No installation needed! Run Python code directly in your browser using JupyterLite.

---

## Quick Start: Python Playground

Click the button below to open an interactive Python environment:

```{jupyterlite} notebooks/playground.ipynb
:width: 100%
:height: 600px
:prompt: Open Python Playground
```

---

## What is this?

This is **JupyterLite** — a complete Jupyter environment running entirely in your browser using [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/) (Python compiled to WebAssembly).

**What you can do:**
- ✅ Run Python code
- ✅ Use NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- ✅ Save your work (in browser storage)
- ✅ No account or installation required

**Limitations:**
- ❌ No file system access to your computer
- ❌ Some packages not available (e.g., TensorFlow)
- ❌ First load takes ~5-10 seconds

## Alternative: Pyodide Console

For quick one-liners, try the Pyodide console directly:

🔗 **[Open Pyodide Console](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/console.html)** (opens in new tab)

## Next Steps

Once you've verified Python works, continue to:

1. **[Data Types](datatypes.md)** — Learn about integers, floats, strings, and booleans
2. **[Variables](variables.md)** — Store and manipulate values
