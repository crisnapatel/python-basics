# Try Python in Your Browser

No installation needed. Run Python code directly in your browser.

```{tip}
Keep this page open in a separate tab while going through the tutorials. You can try out all the code examples here.
```

## Python Playground

Click below to open an interactive Python environment:

```{jupyterlite} notebooks/playground.ipynb
:width: 100%
:height: 600px
:prompt: Open Python Playground
```

## What is this?

This is **JupyterLite**, a complete Jupyter environment that runs entirely in your browser. It uses [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/) to run Python without any server.

You can write and run Python code, import libraries like NumPy and Matplotlib, and your work saves automatically in your browser. No account, no downloads.

A few things to keep in mind: you can't access files on your computer, some packages like TensorFlow aren't supported, and the first load takes a few seconds. For learning Python basics, though, it works great.

## Alternative: Pyodide Console

For quick one-liners, try the Pyodide console directly:

🔗 **[Open Pyodide Console](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/console.html)** (opens in new tab)

## Next Steps

Once you've verified Python works, continue to:

1. **[Data Types](datatypes.md)** - Learn about integers, floats, strings, and booleans
2. **[Variables](variables.md)** - Store and manipulate values
